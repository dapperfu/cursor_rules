# HTML5 Compliance

## Requirement

All HTML files SHALL be HTML5 compliant and SHALL include the HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration.

All HTML files SHALL include a proper charset meta tag in the document head.

## DOCTYPE Declaration

All HTML files SHALL begin with the HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

HTML files SHALL NOT use legacy DOCTYPE declarations (HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, etc.).

## Charset Meta Tag

All HTML files SHALL include the charset meta tag as the first element in the `<head>` section:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!-- other head elements -->
</head>
```

The charset meta tag SHALL be placed before any other content in the head, including the title element.

## Viewport Meta Tag

HTML files intended for responsive design SHOULD include a viewport meta tag:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

This is recommended for all HTML files that will be viewed on mobile devices.

## HTML5 Semantic Elements

HTML files SHALL use HTML5 semantic elements where appropriate instead of generic `<div>` elements:

- `<header>` for page headers
- `<nav>` for navigation sections
- `<main>` for main content
- `<article>` for independent content
- `<section>` for thematic grouping
- `<aside>` for sidebar content
- `<footer>` for page footers

## Language Attribute

The root `<html>` element SHOULD include a `lang` attribute:

```html
<html lang="en">
```

## Reference

All HTML files SHALL conform to the W3C HTML5 specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/

## Template Engines

When using template engines (Jinja2, Handlebars, etc.), the rendered output SHALL be HTML5 compliant. Template syntax within HTML5-compliant structure is acceptable.
