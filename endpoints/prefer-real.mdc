# Real Endpoints Preferred Over Mocks

## Requirement

Mock interfaces SHALL NOT be preferred. SHALL always prefer to use real endpoints with actual authentication.

Live endpoints with real API keys SHALL be preferred over mocks.

Real authentication tokens SHALL be used.

Actual network calls to services SHALL be used.

## Rationale

- Real-world validation: Only real endpoints can verify the app actually works
- API changes detection: Catch breaking changes in APIs immediately
- Authentication flow testing: Verify real token handling and refresh logic
- Performance testing: Measure actual network latency and response times
- Error handling: Test real error conditions and edge cases

## Mock Usage Guidelines

Mocks SHALL only be used when:
- Real endpoints are temporarily unavailable
- Testing error handling scenarios
- Development environment setup
- CI/CD pipeline requirements

SHALL NOT use mocks for happy path testing.

SHALL NOT use mocks for authentication flows.
