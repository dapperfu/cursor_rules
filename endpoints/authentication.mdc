# Endpoint Authentication Handling

## Requirement

If an app returns unauthenticated status, SHALL attempt authentication.

If authentication fails, tests SHALL short circuit and exit gracefully.

SHALL NOT proceed with unauthenticated requests to live endpoints.

All test suites SHALL attempt real authentication first.

Authentication failures SHALL trigger graceful test exit with clear error message.
