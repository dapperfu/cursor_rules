# LaTeX Compilation Error Handling

## Requirement

All LaTeX documents SHALL compile without errors before being committed.

LaTeX compilation errors SHALL be resolved before committing changes.

LaTeX warnings SHALL be reviewed and addressed when they indicate potential issues.

Projects SHALL include mechanisms to verify successful compilation, such as Makefile targets or CI/CD checks.

## Implementation

### Compilation Verification

Projects SHALL include a Makefile target or script to verify successful compilation:

```makefile
# Check if LaTeX document compiles
check: main.tex
	pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex
	@if [ $$? -ne 0 ]; then \
		echo "LaTeX compilation failed"; \
		exit 1; \
	fi
```

### Error Resolution

When LaTeX compilation errors occur:
- Errors SHALL be resolved before committing
- Common error patterns SHALL be documented
- Undefined references SHALL be resolved or explicitly handled
- Missing packages SHALL be added to the document preamble

### Warning Handling

LaTeX warnings SHOULD be addressed when they indicate:
- Undefined references or citations
- Overfull or underfull boxes that affect document layout
- Package compatibility issues
- Deprecated commands or packages

## Rationale

Ensuring LaTeX documents compile successfully:
- Prevents broken documents from being committed
- Maintains document integrity across the project
- Reduces debugging time for other developers
- Enables automated document generation in CI/CD pipelines
