# LaTeX Build Output Management

## Requirement

All LaTeX build artifacts SHALL be excluded from version control via .gitignore.

The .gitignore file SHALL include patterns for common LaTeX build outputs.

## Required .gitignore Patterns

The .gitignore file SHALL include the following patterns for LaTeX build artifacts:

```
# LaTeX build artifacts
*.aux
*.log
*.out
*.toc
*.bbl
*.blg
*.fdb_latexmk
*.fls
*.synctex.gz
*.pdf
*.dvi
*.ps
*.eps
*.figlist
*.makefile
*.figlist
*.auxlock
```

## Rationale

Excluding LaTeX build artifacts from version control:
- Prevents repository bloat from generated files
- Avoids merge conflicts from build artifacts
- Keeps the repository focused on source files
- Follows standard practice for compiled languages

LaTeX build artifacts are generated during compilation and should not be tracked in version control, similar to compiled binaries in other languages.

## Implementation

Projects SHALL ensure that .gitignore includes appropriate patterns for all LaTeX build outputs used in the project. Additional patterns MAY be added for project-specific build tools or workflows.
