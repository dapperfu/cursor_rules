# TeX Live Distribution Requirement

## Requirement

All LaTeX projects SHALL use the TeX Live distribution.

Projects SHALL specify TeX Live installation requirements in documentation or configuration files.

## Rationale

TeX Live provides:
- A comprehensive and maintained LaTeX distribution
- Consistent package availability across platforms
- Standard tooling for LaTeX development
- Regular updates and security patches

Using TeX Live ensures that all developers working on a project have access to the same LaTeX packages and tools, reducing compatibility issues.

## Implementation

Projects SHOULD document TeX Live requirements in:
- README files
- Project documentation
- Build system configuration

Projects MAY specify minimum TeX Live version requirements when necessary for specific package dependencies.
