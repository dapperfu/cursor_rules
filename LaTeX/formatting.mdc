# LaTeX Formatting

## Requirement

All LaTeX files SHALL be formatted using tex-fmt.

LaTeX files SHALL be formatted using tex-fmt before being committed. Projects SHALL include Makefile targets for formatting operations.

## Rationale

Consistent LaTeX formatting:
- Improves code readability across the project
- Reduces merge conflicts from formatting differences
- Makes code reviews focus on content rather than style
- Enables automated formatting checks in CI/CD pipelines

tex-fmt provides LaTeX-specific formatting rules that handle the unique syntax and structure of LaTeX documents.

## Implementation

### Makefile Targets

Projects SHALL include the following Makefile targets for formatting:

```makefile
# Format all LaTeX code
format:
	tex-fmt *.tex **/*.tex *.sty **/*.sty *.cls **/*.cls *.dtx **/*.dtx *.ins **/*.ins

# Check if code is formatted (for CI)
fmt-check:
	tex-fmt --check *.tex **/*.tex *.sty **/*.sty *.cls **/*.cls *.dtx **/*.dtx *.ins **/*.ins
```

The `format` target SHALL format all LaTeX code in the project. The `fmt-check` target SHALL verify that code is properly formatted without making changes, suitable for use in CI/CD pipelines.

### Pre-commit Integration

Projects SHOULD integrate formatting checks into pre-commit hooks to ensure all code is formatted before commits.

## Exceptions

This requirement does NOT apply to:
- Bibliography files (.bib)
- Generated files that are automatically created
- Third-party package files in distribution directories
