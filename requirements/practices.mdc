# Requirements Management Best Practices

## Requirement

SHALL follow these best practices for requirements management:

### Requirement Writing

- SHALL write clear, testable requirements
- SHALL use consistent terminology
- SHALL include acceptance criteria

### Traceability

- SHALL link requirements to code implementation
- SHALL maintain parent-child relationships
- SHALL document requirement changes

### Validation

- SHALL run `make reqs-validate` regularly
- SHALL ensure all requirements have proper links
- SHALL check for orphaned requirements

### Documentation

- SHALL export requirements for stakeholders
- SHALL maintain up-to-date requirement documents
- SHALL use consistent formatting and structure

## Migration Strategy

- Existing requirements in `requirements/` directory SHALL remain unchanged
- New requirements SHALL be added to doorstop
- SHALL gradually migrate existing requirements over time
- SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing documentation
