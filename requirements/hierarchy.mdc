# Requirements Document Hierarchy

## Requirement

Requirements management SHALL use the `doorstop` Python package with a hierarchical document structure.

Requirements SHALL be organized in a three-level hierarchy:

- **SYS** (System Requirements): High-level system requirements
- **SRS** (Software Requirements): Detailed software requirements (child of SYS)
- **TEST** (Test Cases): Test cases and validation criteria (child of SRS)

## File Structure Requirement

Requirements SHALL be stored in the following directory structure:

```
reqs/
├── sys/           # System requirements (SYS)
│   ├── .doorstop.yml
│   └── SYS001.yml
├── srs/           # Software requirements (SRS)
│   ├── .doorstop.yml
│   └── SRS001.yml
└── test/          # Test cases (TEST)
    ├── .doorstop.yml
    └── TEST001.yml
```

## Requirement ID Format

Requirement IDs SHALL follow these formats:

- System Requirements: `SYS001`, `SYS002`, etc.
- Software Requirements: `SRS001`, `SRS002`, etc.
- Test Cases: `TEST001`, `TEST002`, etc.
