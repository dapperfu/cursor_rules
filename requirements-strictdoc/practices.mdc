- SHALL maintain consistent document structure within each type
- SHALL use proper document metadata (title, version, date, etc.)
- SHALL follow StrictDoc document template conventions

## Traceability

- SHALL link requirements to code implementation using requirement IDs in comments
- SHALL maintain parent-child relationships between documents
- SHALL document requirement changes and version history
- SHALL establish bidirectional traceability between requirements and tests
- SHALL link design documents to corresponding requirements

## Validation

- SHALL run `make strictdoc-validate` before committing changes
- SHALL ensure all requirements have proper links and references
- SHALL check for orphaned requirements and broken links
- SHALL verify requirement IDs follow naming conventions
- SHALL validate document structure against MIL-STD-498 standards

## Documentation Maintenance

- SHALL keep requirements documentation up-to-date with code changes
- SHALL regenerate HTML output after any source document changes
- SHALL review and update requirements during code reviews
- SHALL maintain consistent formatting across all documents
- SHALL export requirements for stakeholders when needed

## Integration with Development

- SHALL reference requirement IDs in code comments
- SHALL update requirements when implementing features
- SHALL link test cases to specific requirements
- SHALL maintain requirements during refactoring
- SHALL document requirement changes in commit messages

## Configuration Management

- SHALL use StrictDoc configuration files (e.g., `strictdoc.toml` or `strictdoc_config.py`)
- SHALL configure HTML output directory to `requirements_html/`
- SHALL maintain consistent StrictDoc version across the project
- SHALL document StrictDoc configuration in project documentation
