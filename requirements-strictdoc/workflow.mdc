# StrictDoc Workflow and Make Targets

## Requirement

SHALL use StrictDoc commands for requirements management workflow.

SHALL provide make targets for all requirements management operations.

## Make Targets

The following make targets SHALL be implemented:

- `make strictdoc-init`: Initialize StrictDoc project structure (one-time)
- `make strictdoc-generate`: Generate HTML documentation from `.sdoc` files
- `make strictdoc-validate`: Validate all StrictDoc documents
- `make strictdoc-export`: Export requirements to various formats (HTML, PDF, etc.)
- `make strictdoc-serve`: Start StrictDoc web server for viewing/editing
- `make strictdoc-tree`: View document tree structure
- `make strictdoc-help`: Show StrictDoc management help

## Make Targets Requirement

All requirements management operations SHALL have corresponding make targets.

Make targets SHALL use the virtual environment Python and StrictDoc installation.

Make targets SHALL follow the pattern: `make strictdoc-<operation>`

## Adding Requirements

When adding requirements, SHALL follow this process:

1. Create or edit `.sdoc` files in the appropriate directory
2. Use `make strictdoc-validate` to check document validity
3. Use `make strictdoc-generate` to generate HTML output
4. Commit both source `.sdoc` files and generated HTML files

## Linking Requirements

- SHALL use StrictDoc's requirement linking syntax
- SHALL reference requirements by ID in code comments
- SHALL maintain traceability between documents
- SHALL link test descriptions to specific requirements

## Validation

- SHALL run `make strictdoc-validate` before committing changes
- SHALL ensure all requirements have proper links
- SHALL check for orphaned requirements
- SHALL verify document structure follows MIL-STD-498 standards
