# StrictDoc Pre-Commit HTML Generation

## Requirement

HTML documentation SHALL be generated automatically before each git commit.

A pre-commit hook SHALL be configured to run StrictDoc HTML generation.

## Pre-Commit Hook Requirement

A git pre-commit hook SHALL execute `make strictdoc-generate` before allowing commits.

The pre-commit hook SHALL ensure HTML documentation is up-to-date with source `.sdoc` files.

The pre-commit hook SHALL fail the commit if HTML generation fails.

## Implementation

The pre-commit hook SHALL be located at `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and SHALL be executable.

The pre-commit hook SHALL run StrictDoc generation using the project's virtual environment.

The pre-commit hook SHALL only run when `.sdoc` files are staged for commit or when HTML output is out of date.

## HTML Output Synchronization

Generated HTML files SHALL be committed alongside source `.sdoc` files.

HTML generation SHALL occur automatically before each commit to ensure documentation consistency.

If HTML generation fails, the commit SHALL be blocked until the issue is resolved.

## Manual Generation

While pre-commit hooks provide automatic generation, developers MAY manually run `make strictdoc-generate` at any time.

Manual generation SHALL use the same make target as the pre-commit hook.
