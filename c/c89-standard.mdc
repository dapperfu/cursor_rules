# C89/C90 (ANSI C) Standard Compliance

## Requirement

All C code SHALL conform to the C89/C90 (ANSI C) standard.

C99 and later standard features SHALL NOT be used, including but not limited to:
- Variable-length arrays (VLAs)
- Single-line comments (//)
- Designated initializers
- Compound literals
- Variable declarations anywhere in a block
- Flexible array members
- Long long type
- Boolean type (_Bool or stdbool.h)

All function declarations SHALL appear before their first use.

All variable declarations SHALL be at the beginning of a block, before any executable statements.

Compiler flags SHALL be set to enforce C89/C90 compliance (e.g., `-std=c89` or `-ansi`).
