# MISRA C Compliance

## Requirement

All C code SHALL comply with MISRA C:2023 guidelines, with fallback to MISRA C:2012 where necessary.

All C code SHALL be checked using cppcheck with the MISRA addon enabled.

MISRA compliance checking SHALL be enforced in CI/CD pipelines.

Any deviations from MISRA guidelines SHALL be documented with justification in code comments or project documentation.

MISRA rule violations SHALL be addressed before code is merged, unless a documented deviation exists.
