# Linux Kernel Style Naming Conventions

## Requirement

All function names SHALL use snake_case (lowercase with underscores).

All variable names SHALL use snake_case (lowercase with underscores).

All type names (typedefs, structs, enums) SHALL use snake_case with appropriate suffixes (e.g., `_t` for typedefs, `_s` for structs).

All constant names SHALL use UPPER_CASE with underscores.

Function and variable names SHALL use module prefixes to avoid namespace collisions (e.g., `module_function_name`).

Names SHALL be descriptive and avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood.

Single-letter variable names SHALL only be used for loop counters or mathematical variables where the meaning is clear from context.
