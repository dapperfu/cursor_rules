# Header File Guards

## Requirement

All header files SHALL use include guards to prevent multiple inclusion.

Header files SHALL prefer `#pragma once` as the primary protection mechanism.

Header files SHALL also include traditional `#ifndef/#define/#endif` guards as a fallback for compilers that do not support `#pragma once`.

Include guard names SHALL follow a consistent naming convention, typically based on the file path (e.g., `PROJECT_MODULE_FILENAME_H`).

Include guards SHALL be placed immediately after any file-level comments and before any includes or other preprocessor directives.
