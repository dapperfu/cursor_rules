# Compiler Warning Enforcement

## Requirement

All C code SHALL be compiled with strict warning flags enabled.

For GCC, the following flags SHALL be used: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.

For Clang, equivalent flags SHALL be used: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` or `-Weverything -Werror` (with appropriate suppressions).

No warnings SHALL be allowed in production builds.

Warning suppressions SHALL only be used when absolutely necessary and SHALL be documented with justification.

Warning suppressions SHALL be as specific as possible (suppress specific warnings, not all warnings).
