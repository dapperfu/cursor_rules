# Makefile Target Dependencies

## Requirement

All makefiles SHALL use an actual file/folder where possible as a target.

For example: `python -mvenv venv_$(basename $(pwd))` generates `venv_$(basename $(pwd))`. Any target that depends on Python having the venv built SHALL use `venv` as a dependency so that GNU make resolves everything correctly and in the right order.
