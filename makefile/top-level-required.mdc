# Top-Level Makefile Requirement

## Requirement

All projects SHALL have a top-level Makefile to orchestrate the project.

## Required Targets

The top-level Makefile SHALL provide the following standard targets:

1. **`make clean`** - Clean the project (remove build artifacts, temporary files, etc.)

2. **`make build`** - Build binary projects. For interpreted projects, this target may be a no-op or may perform setup/installation tasks.

3. **`make run`** - Run the project. For binary projects, this SHALL execute the built binary. For interpreted projects, this SHALL execute the project using the appropriate interpreter.

## Additional Targets

The Makefile SHALL include other make targets as appropriate for the project type, such as:

- `make test` - Run tests
- `make install` - Install the project
- `make lint` - Run linting tools
- `make format` - Format code
- `make help` - Display available targets and their descriptions

## Rationale

A standardized top-level Makefile provides a consistent interface for building, running, and maintaining projects across different languages and build systems. This enables developers to quickly understand and work with any project using familiar commands.
