# Model Evaluation

## Requirement

All machine learning models SHALL have evaluation scripts separate from training scripts.

Evaluation scripts SHALL compute standard metrics for the task type.

Evaluation results SHALL be saved in a structured format (JSON, CSV, or report).

Evaluation SHALL support both validation and test sets.

Evaluation scripts SHALL accept model checkpoint paths as arguments.

## Separate Evaluation Scripts

Evaluation SHALL be implemented in separate scripts from training:
- Training scripts focus on training logic
- Evaluation scripts focus on evaluation logic
- Separation allows evaluation without retraining

## Standard Metrics

Evaluation scripts SHALL compute standard metrics for the task type:
- Classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
- Regression: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
- Ranking: NDCG, MAP, MRR
- Other task-specific metrics as appropriate

## Structured Output

Evaluation results SHALL be saved in structured format:
- JSON format for programmatic access
- CSV format for tabular data
- Text reports for human readability
- Or combination of formats

## Dataset Support

Evaluation scripts SHALL support:
- Validation set evaluation
- Test set evaluation
- Custom dataset evaluation
- Batch evaluation of multiple checkpoints

## Command-Line Interface

Evaluation scripts SHALL accept:
- `--checkpoint` - Path to model checkpoint
- `--data-path` - Path to evaluation dataset
- `--split` - Dataset split (validation, test, or custom)
- `--output` - Path to save evaluation results

## Example Usage

```bash
python evaluate.py \
  --checkpoint checkpoints/model_name/checkpoint_best.pth \
  --data-path data/test/ \
  --split test \
  --output results/evaluation_test.json
```
