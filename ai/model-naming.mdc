# Model Naming Conventions

## Requirement

All machine learning models SHALL be named using the pattern: `{ProjectName}{Architecture}{Variant}`.

Model files and directories SHALL use consistent naming conventions.

Model names SHALL be descriptive and indicate the architecture type.

## Naming Pattern

Model names SHALL follow: `{ProjectName}{Architecture}{Variant}`

Examples:
- `EucherAlphaGo` - Project: Eucher, Architecture: AlphaGo
- `PokerMonteCarlo` - Project: Poker, Architecture: MonteCarlo
- `ImageClassifierResNet50` - Project: ImageClassifier, Architecture: ResNet50
- `TextClassifierBERT` - Project: TextClassifier, Architecture: BERT

## File and Directory Naming

Model-related files and directories SHALL use consistent naming:
- Model checkpoints: `checkpoints/{model_name}/`
- Model definitions: `models/{model_name}.py` or `models/{model_name}/`
- Configuration files: `configs/{model_name}.yaml`
- Logs: `logs/{model_name}/`

## Naming Guidelines

Model names SHALL:
- Use PascalCase or CamelCase
- Be descriptive enough to identify the architecture
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely recognized
- Include project context when multiple projects exist
