# Training Scripts

## Requirement

All machine learning models SHALL be accompanied by training scripts with appropriate help documentation.

Training scripts SHALL accept command-line arguments for hyperparameters, data paths, and configuration.

Each training script SHALL have a corresponding shell script wrapper with sane defaults.

Shell wrapper scripts SHALL be executable and documented with usage examples.

## Training Script Requirements

Training scripts SHALL:
- Provide `--help` or `-h` documentation explaining all arguments
- Accept hyperparameters as command-line arguments
- Accept data paths as command-line arguments
- Accept configuration file paths as optional arguments
- Use argparse, click, or similar argument parsing libraries with full help text

## Rich Dashboard Requirements

Training scripts SHALL include a Rich dashboard to display training progress and keep users informed.

The Rich dashboard SHALL display:
- Training loss and validation loss (current and history)
- Other relevant metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.) as appropriate for the task
- Current epoch/iteration and total progress
- Training time elapsed and estimated time remaining
- Learning rate and other key hyperparameters
- System metrics (GPU/CPU utilization, memory usage)

The dashboard SHALL update in real-time during training to provide live feedback.

Training scripts SHALL display humorous quips from the `fortune` command every 30 seconds to keep the training process engaging.

## Progress Display Fallback

Training scripts SHALL support fallback progress display options:
- `--tqdm` flag to use tqdm progress bars instead of Rich dashboard
- `--no-rich` flag to disable Rich dashboard and display raw output

When `--tqdm` or `--no-rich` flags are used, the script SHALL still display training metrics but without the Rich dashboard interface.

## Shell Wrapper Requirements

Shell wrapper scripts SHALL:
- Be executable (have execute permissions)
- Include usage examples in comments or help text
- Provide sensible default values for common hyperparameters
- Allow overriding defaults via command-line arguments
- Document required environment variables (if any)

## Example Structure

```
train_model.py          # Main training script with --help
train_model.sh          # Shell wrapper with defaults
```
