# Cursor Plans Folder Location

## Requirement

All CURSOR plans SHALL be saved to a `plans/` folder located at the project root (same level as `.cursor/`, `src/`, etc.).

## Rationale

Centralizing plans in a dedicated folder at the project root ensures:
- Easy discovery of planning documents
- Consistent organization across projects
- Clear separation from implementation code
- Standard location for all team members
