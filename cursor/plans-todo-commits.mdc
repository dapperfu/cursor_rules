# Cursor Plans TODO Commit Traceability

## Requirement

TODO checkoffs in CURSOR plan files SHALL be committed together with the file changes that complete those TODOs. This enables traceability: you can see when a TODO was checked off and which code changes completed it in the same commit.

This is an exception to the general atomic commit rule specified in `git/commit-atomicity.mdc` (Exception 2: TODO Checkoff Traceability).

When 2 files are tightly coupled and must change together atomically (per Exception 1 in `git/commit-atomicity.mdc`), the TODO checkoff may be committed together with these 2 files if the TODO is completed by the changes in those files, or separately if it completes a different TODO.

## Rationale

Committing TODO checkoffs together with the code changes that complete them ensures:
- Traceability between requirements (plans) and implementation (code)
- Clear git history showing when each TODO was completed and by which changes
- Ability to trace code changes back to their originating requirements
- Better understanding of project evolution through linked commits
- Requirements documentation remains synchronized with code changes

## Integration

This rule complements:
- `git/commit-atomicity.mdc` - general atomic commit rule (this is Exception 2)
- `cursor/plans-todo-updates.mdc` - ensures TODOs are updated as work progresses
- `cursor/plans-commit-execution.mdc` - ensures atomic commits during plan execution
- `git/commit-format.mdc` - ensures proper commit message format
