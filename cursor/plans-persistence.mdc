# Cursor Plans Persistence

## Requirement

All CURSOR plans SHALL be saved to the `plans/` folder in the project root and SHALL be committed to git for full traceability.

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Plans Folder**: All CURSOR plans SHALL be saved to a `plans/` folder located at the project root (same level as `.cursor/`, `src/`, etc.).

2. **Git Tracking**: The `plans/` folder SHALL be tracked in git. It SHALL NOT be added to `.gitignore`.

3. **Commit Requirement**: All plan files SHALL be committed to git following the standard commit message format requirements (see `git/commit-format.mdc`).

4. **Naming Convention**: Plan files SHALL use descriptive names that indicate their purpose and creation date/timestamp when possible.

5. **Traceability**: Plans SHALL be preserved in git history to enable:
   - Review of planning decisions
   - Audit trail of development approach
   - Understanding of project evolution
   - Recovery of planning context

## Rationale

CURSOR plans are currently transient and not persisted, which means:
- Planning decisions are lost after execution
- No audit trail exists for how features were planned
- Historical context is unavailable for future reference
- Team members cannot review planning approaches

By requiring plans to be saved and committed, we ensure:
- Full traceability of planning decisions
- Ability to review and learn from past planning approaches
- Historical record of project development
- Better collaboration through shared planning context
