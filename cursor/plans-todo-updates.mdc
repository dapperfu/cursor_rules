# Cursor Plans TODO Updates

## Requirement

TODOs in CURSOR plans SHALL be updated to reflect completion status as work progresses. When a TODO item is completed, it SHALL be marked as completed in the plan file.

## Rationale

Updating TODOs in plans as they are completed ensures:
- Design decisions and planning context are preserved
- Requirements traceability is maintained (linking code to requirements)
- Project evolution history is accurately documented
- Clear status of what has been completed vs. what remains
- Plans serve as living requirements documentation
- Code changes can be traced back to their originating requirements
