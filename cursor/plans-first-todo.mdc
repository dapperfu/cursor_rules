# Cursor Plans First TODO Item

## Requirement

When creating a plan, saving the plan to the `plans/` folder SHALL be written as the first TODO item in the plan.

## Rationale

Making plan persistence the first TODO item ensures:
- Plans are saved before execution begins
- No planning work is lost if execution is interrupted
- Plans are committed to git for traceability
- Planning decisions are preserved for review
