# Cursor Plans Question Requirements

## Requirement

All plans SHALL ask at least 10 questions, minimum, to ensure the plan is designed according to how the user would like it.

These questions SHALL prompt users with edge cases they may not have thought about, helping to identify potential issues, clarify requirements, and ensure comprehensive planning.

## Rationale

Asking comprehensive questions ensures:
- Requirements are fully understood before implementation
- Edge cases are identified early
- Potential issues are discovered during planning
- User preferences are captured before work begins
- Plans are more robust and less likely to need major revisions
