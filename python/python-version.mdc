# Python Version and Modern Practices

## Requirement

All Python projects SHALL target Python 3.10 or higher.

All Python code SHALL use the most idiomatic Python practices for 2025, including:

- Type hints with modern syntax (PEP 604 union types: `str | int` instead of `Union[str, int]`)
- Structural pattern matching (match/case statements) where appropriate
- Dataclasses and modern data structures
- Context managers and async/await patterns where applicable
- f-strings for string formatting
- Path objects from `pathlib` instead of string paths
- Modern exception handling patterns
- Type guards and type narrowing
- Generic types and type variables for reusable code
