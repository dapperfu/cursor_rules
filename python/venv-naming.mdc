# Python Virtual Environment Naming

## Requirement

Virtual environments SHALL be named `venv_$(basename $(pwd))`.

This makes them unique among multiple venv environment projects.

So given a project `/project/foo` the venv in that project SHALL be `venv_foo`.

This naming convention SHALL be used to identify which environment is active in bash.
