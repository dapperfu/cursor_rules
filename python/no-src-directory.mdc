# Python Source Code Directory Structure

## Requirement

The `src/` directory SHALL NOT be used for source code in Python projects.

Source code SHALL be placed directly in the project root or in appropriately named directories that reflect the project structure.

This rule prevents the use of the `src/` layout pattern in favor of simpler, more direct project structures.
