# Project Naming Convention

## Requirement

Unless otherwise specified, the project name SHALL inherit the top level folder name.

For example, if a project is located at `/projects/my_project`, the project name SHALL be `my_project`.

This ensures consistency between directory structure and project naming throughout configuration files, documentation, and code references.
