# StrictDoc Directory Structure for GitHub Pages

## Requirement

StrictDoc requirements source files SHALL be stored in the `reqs/` directory.

Generated HTML files SHALL be stored in the `reqs/html/` directory for GitHub Pages publishing.

## Directory Structure

Requirements SHALL follow this directory structure:

```
reqs/
├── html/              # Generated HTML output (for GitHub Pages)
│   ├── srs/          # HTML output for System Requirements
│   ├── sss/          # HTML output for Software Requirements
│   ├── sdd/          # HTML output for Design Documents
│   ├── irs/          # HTML output for Interface Requirements
│   ├── tp/           # HTML output for Test Plans
│   └── td/           # HTML output for Test Descriptions
├── srs/              # System Requirements source files
│   └── *.sdoc
├── sss/              # Software Requirements source files
│   └── *.sdoc
├── sdd/              # Design Documents source files
│   └── *.sdoc
├── irs/              # Interface Requirements source files
│   └── *.sdoc
├── tp/               # Test Plans source files
│   └── *.sdoc
└── td/               # Test Descriptions source files
    └── *.sdoc
```

## Source Files Location

- All `.sdoc` source files SHALL be located in `reqs/` or its subdirectories
- Source files SHALL be organized by document type in subdirectories (e.g., `reqs/srs/`, `reqs/sss/`)
- Source files SHALL NOT be placed in the `reqs/html/` directory

## HTML Output Location

- Generated HTML files SHALL be stored in `reqs/html/` directory
- HTML output SHALL mirror the source document structure within `reqs/html/`
- The `reqs/html/` directory SHALL be configured as the StrictDoc HTML output directory

## Source to HTML Mapping

Each `.sdoc` source file SHALL have a corresponding HTML file in the `reqs/html/` directory.

The HTML file SHALL be located in the same subdirectory structure as the source file.

For example:
- `reqs/srs/SRS001.sdoc` → `reqs/html/srs/SRS001.html`
- `reqs/sss/SSS001.sdoc` → `reqs/html/sss/SSS001.html`

## GitHub Pages Configuration

- The `reqs/html/` directory SHALL be configured as the GitHub Pages source directory
- HTML files in `reqs/html/` SHALL be published to GitHub Pages
- StrictDoc SHALL be configured to output HTML to `reqs/html/` directory

## StrictDoc Configuration

StrictDoc SHALL be configured to output HTML to the `reqs/html/` directory.

The HTML output directory SHALL be specified in StrictDoc configuration (e.g., `strictdoc.toml` or `strictdoc_config.py`).

Example configuration:
```toml
[project]
title = "Requirements"
html_root = "reqs/html"
```

## HTML File Maintenance

- HTML files SHALL be regenerated whenever source `.sdoc` files are modified
- HTML files SHALL be committed to version control alongside source files
- HTML files SHALL NOT be manually edited; all changes SHALL be made to source `.sdoc` files
