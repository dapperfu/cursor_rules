# C++ Naming Conventions

## Requirement

C++ code SHALL follow consistent naming conventions:

- Classes, structs, and type names SHALL use PascalCase (e.g., `MyClass`, `DataStructure`)
- Functions and variables SHALL use snake_case (e.g., `get_value()`, `user_name`)

Naming conventions SHALL be applied consistently throughout the codebase.
