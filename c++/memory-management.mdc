# C++ Memory Management

## Requirement

C++ code SHALL use smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) instead of raw pointers where possible.

C++ code SHALL follow RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles.

Manual memory management (new/delete) SHALL be avoided except where absolutely necessary and SHALL be clearly documented.
