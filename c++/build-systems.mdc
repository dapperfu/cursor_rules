# C++ Build Systems

## Requirement

C++ projects SHALL support both Makefile and CMake build systems.

Build targets SHALL be consistent across both build systems (e.g., `build`, `test`, `clean`, `format`, `lint`).

Formatting and linting tools SHALL be integrated into both Makefile and CMake build systems.
